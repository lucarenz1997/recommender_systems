If you want to run the project, you will need to do the following:
1. Connect to the google drive and add the train dataset in the following directory: "/content/drive/MyDrive/Recommender/train.csv"
2. From that point, you can run the data preprocessing notebook which will save the cleaned dataset in your google drive.
3. From there on, each model can be run on the individual notebook and the recommendations will be shown at the end of the notebook.
